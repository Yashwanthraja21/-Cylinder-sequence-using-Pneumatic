# -Cylinder-sequence-using-Pneumatic
This project automates pneumatic cylinder sequences (A and B) using Python. Users input actions like extension (+) and retraction (-), and the program processes them step-by-step to generate a bar chart, visually displaying each cylinder's state transitions.
Here's a **step-by-step procedure** to execute the Python script and generate the image based on the pneumatic cylinder sequence:

# Pneumatic Cylinder Sequence Automation

This project automates the sequence of actions for a pneumatic system involving two cylinders (A and B) using Python. Users can define a sequence of cylinder operations (such as extension `+` and retraction `-`) for each cylinder. The program dynamically visualizes the sequence with a functional bar chart showing the states of the cylinders at each step.

## Features
- **Dynamic Sequence Input**: Accepts cylinder actions like `A+`, `B-`, `A-`, etc.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Displays the state of the cylinders (extended/retracted) for each step in a sequence.
- **Customizable**: You can change the sequence as needed and view updated images.
- **Easy-to-Understand Output**: A simple, functional image that highlights the state transitions (extended/retracted) of each cylinder.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:
- **Python 3.x** (tested on version 3.11)
- **Pillow** (for image handling)
- **Matplotlib** (for plotting and visualization)
  
Install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install matplotlib pillow
```

## Project Setup

1. **Download the required images**:
   - **Extended** and **Retracted** images for both cylinders (A and B).
     - Make sure the images are named `extended.png` and `retracted.png`, and are placed in the same directory as the Python script.

2. **Input the sequence**:
   - When running the script, you will be prompted to enter the sequence in the form of `A+`, `A-`, `B+`, `B-`, etc.

3. **Run the script**:
   - Simply run the Python script and provide the sequence as input. The program will generate a functional image showing the cylinder states at each step.
   - Example sequence: `A+ B- A- B+`.

4. **Output**:
   - A functional image (`functional_cylinder_sequence.png`) will be saved in the current directory, showing the sequence with the respective states of cylinders A and B.

## Example Usage

1. **Input**:
   ```bash
   Enter the cylinder sequence (e.g., A+B+A-B-), separated by spaces.
   Sequence: A+ B- A- B+
   ```
   
2. **Output**:
   - The program will generate a visualization with the following steps:
     - **Step 1**: Cylinder A Extended, Cylinder B Retracted
     - **Step 2**: Cylinder A Extended, Cylinder B Retracted
     - **Step 3**: Cylinder A Retracted, Cylinder B Retracted
     - **Step 4**: Cylinder A Retracted, Cylinder B Extended

3. The functional image (`functional_cylinder_sequence.png`) will show the sequence visually, with each cylinder state labeled as "Extended" or "Retracted" for every step.

## Code Explanation

### 1. **get_sequence_input()**:
   Prompts the user to input a sequence for the cylinder actions (e.g., `A+ B- A- B+`).

### 2. **generate_cylinder_sequence_image()**:
   - Loads images for both "Extended" and "Retracted" states.
   - Iterates over the provided sequence, determining the state of each cylinder after each action.
   - Generates a plot showing the state transitions of both cylinders for each step in the sequence.

### 3. **Matplotlib Visualization**:
   - Uses `matplotlib` to create a plot with images representing each cylinder's state.
   - Labels each cylinder state as either "Extended" or "Retracted" below the corresponding image.

### 4. **Output**:
   - The generated sequence is saved as a functional image and displayed.

## Example Sequence and Output

### Example Input:
```bash
Enter the cylinder sequence (e.g., A+B+A-B-), separated by spaces.
Sequence: A+ B- A- B+
```

### Generated Output Image:
- **Step 1**: Cylinder A Extended, Cylinder B Retracted
- **Step 2**: Cylinder A Extended, Cylinder B Retracted
- **Step 3**: Cylinder A Retracted, Cylinder B Retracted
- **Step 4**: Cylinder A Retracted, Cylinder B Extended

## Troubleshooting

- **Error: Image not showing properly**:
  Ensure the `extended.png` and `retracted.png` images are correctly placed in the project directory.
  
- **Invalid Input**:
  If you enter an invalid action (e.g., `C+`), the program will print an error message and stop.
